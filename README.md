# 21cmPS
This repo is based on Fisher forecasting and aims to predict the sensitivity of current and future Power Spectrum measurements of the 21-cm signal based on beyond CDM models.

Simulating the 21-cm PS is based on [21cmFirstCLASS](https://github.com/jordanflitter/21cmFirstCLASS) package. It can be used with the modified versions of CLASS code, in particular the dmeff version.
