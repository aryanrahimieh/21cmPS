# 21cmPSense
This repo is based on Fisher forecasting and aims to predict the sensitivity of current and future Power Spectrum measurements of the 21-cm signal based on beyond CDM models.

Simulating the 21-cm PS is based on [21cmFirstCLASS](https://github.com/jordanflitter/21cmFirstCLASS) package.

Iâ€™ve been working on repos (21cmFast, 21cmEMU, 21cmFirstCLASS) related to the 21-cm power spectrum and reviewing the literature about recent works. 21cmFirstCLASS repo has the feature to use modified versions of CLASS, including the Dmeff version, and I have it running both on my Mac and the cluster. I was able to reproduce their results (PS plot except for HERA noise). In their analysis, they actually analyzed a specific case (fixed mass and cross-section) of Coulomb-like DM, and they mentioned they will do future work with more changing masses, cross-sections, and ns (see reference 128). Just wanted to have a check point with you at this stage. Please let me know if you have any
