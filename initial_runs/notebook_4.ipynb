    "21cmFirstCLASS is an extension of the popular 21cmFAST code that interfaces with CLASS to generate initial conditions consistent with the input cosmological model. These initial conditions can be set during the time of recombination, allowing one to compute the 21cm signal (and its spatial fluctuations) throughout the dark ages, as well as in the proceeding cosmic dawn and reionization epochs, just like in the standard 21cmFAST.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary of previous notebooks\n",
    "- In Notebook #1, you learned how to install 21cmFirstCLASS and its dependencies, how to run the code for basic settings, and how to plot easily the simulation outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Notebook #2, you learned about the new physical features (in &Lambda;CDM cosmology) that have been introduced to 21cmFirstCLASS and how to restore conditions similar to the original 21cmFAST.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Notebook #3, you learned how to study exotic models of dark matter (fuzzy dark matter and scattering dark matter) with 21cmFirstCLASS.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In this notebook you will learn how to...\n",
    "- Install the code and all the dependencies it requires\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute the noise of the HERA experiment (with 21cmSense) and plot it on top of the 21cm power spectrum \n",
